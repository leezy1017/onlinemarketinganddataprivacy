<h1>Browser Fingerprinting</h1>

<p class="ex1" align="justify">
There are several methods that can be used by a website to track its users and store their information without the user’s knowledge.  One of these methods is called browser fingerprinting.  As the internet evolves, it is becoming harder and harder to browse anonymously. 
 The internet users that are concerned with networks 
 and websites tracking them, will generally perform the common task of deleting browser cookies, 
<br>but as technology continues to grow, this is even becoming less effective.  
The power of the browser fingerprint continues to challenge Internet anonymity,
 by behaving as an invisible cookie that cannot be deleted.
	The data that can unknowingly be collected from an oblivious internet user 
	can range from locations, interests, incomes, family status, and much more. 
	This type of tracking activity to most people is highly invasive and inappropriate,
	creating a nervous population of online browsing.  Unfortunately, browser fingerprinting 
	is becoming very common.  The information collected is quite comprehensive and often includes
	the browser type and version, operating system and version, screen resolution, supported fonts, plugins,
	time zone, language and font preferences, and even hardware configurations.   
	
	<br>The browser fingerprint took another huge step when the canvas 
	technique was introduced.  This is the dangerous technology that allowed the 
	fingerprint to capture the actual pixel value produced while visiting a website,
	which then allows a site to continue to track its users long after they are gone. 
	Even after futile attempts of concerned Internet users deleting cookies and hiding IP addresses, 
	the fingerprint remains.  The canvas fingerprint enables sites to re-identify and re-cookie the 
	user’s system, essentially rejecting their efforts to remain private.      
	Browser fingerprinting is an extremely problematic technology, when it comes down to the privacy of the web surfer.  
	
	<br>It gathers many details about your particular browser and computer, allowing a website to easily identify an individual out of thousands of visitors.  
	There are advocacy groups whom understand the public’s concern of Internet privacy invasion, and are continually fighting the Privacy Internet battle.
	One of these groups is known as The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation), whom is a nonprofit privacy organization, whom is constantly working to
	ensure the publics rights and freedoms on the internet, as technology continues to grow.  The EFF uses leading activists and attorneys to fight
	illegal surveillance, such as Browser Fingerprinting.  The EFF continues to educate the public through workshops, guides, the press and much more.  
	This is just the beginning of a long road in the fight for the online rights of Internet users.
	Right now, there is a reintroduced draft bill, called the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights that is designed to 
	protect consumers from the release of their personal information, as well as provide knowledge of how data
	is kept and collected by marketers.  This bill would also enforce data collectors to comply with the governing
	industry standard, or that business would be subject to enforcement from the FTC (Federal Trade Commission). 
	There are many ways to proactively try to protect our privacy as Internet users and online consumers.  <br>
	Most web browsers have settings that disable third party tracking cookies as well as notify the user when sites try to install add-ons. 
	These very simple security settings will help prevent unwanted tracking.  Also, some privacy browser settings will
	allow the individual user to express the preference to not be tracked by websites.  The downside of using these blocking
	techniques on websites is it can possibly interfere with website usability and personalization. Ultimately, it is the 
	Internet user who decides what personal information is being disclosed and shared on the World Wide Web, so the best 
	form of privacy protection, is education in the different systems and programs available that will assist in providing 
	the level of anonymity that is desired by each individual user.
